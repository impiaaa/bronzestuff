## Bronze Stuff

A tiny Minecraft mod for 1.6.4 that adds bronze armor and tools. It does 
*not* add bronze ingots, required to craft the items, nor copper or tin 
ingots or ores.

I wrote this with the hope that it would be useful for modpacks that have
bronze (from, e.g., Thermal Expansion, Forestry, or Tinkers Construct), but do
*not* include IndustrialCraft 2 or Metallurgy, mods that add bronze 
items. This mod can be configured to use balance numbers from either of 
those two mods (in general, IC2 is better).

I realize the textures look like poop. They were made automatically by mapping
the color of Tinkers Construct bronze onto Minecraft iron items. Feel 
free to submit something better!
